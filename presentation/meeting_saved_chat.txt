13:35:19 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Jon's opening:
13:35:55 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	You can put Winnie first.
13:36:52 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Slide 2: too many words… please clean up
13:36:58 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 2: forgot time of simulation. forgot energy consumption
13:37:20 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	also add software complexity...that's also an issue.
13:37:29 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	My God. Learn his name.
13:37:45 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Not about the expensive license. It’s about expensive human and computation resources
13:38:26 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 3: nice figure!! dimensions? How big is that thing?
13:38:54 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Say what grating couplers are for first: to couple light an in, essential for any planar Photonic circuits
13:39:14 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	what's a hyperparameter?
13:39:37 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Pretty good opening.
13:39:44 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Deng's stuff:
13:40:15 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Put Prof MacEachern’s name in one line on title page
13:41:00 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Slide 7. Put appropriate indent spacing
13:42:17 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Use “Presenter: Deng xxxx” instead of author
13:42:57 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Slide 10: why 200?
13:43:00 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Some figures are cut and paste and blurry. Make your own figures or cite the source. It's best to make your own figures. Otherwise I see it as a low effort presentation.
13:43:57 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Learning software is not an engineering challenge. This is weak sauce.
13:44:09 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	You need to discuss actual engineering challenges.
13:44:53 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	working around large datasets is an engineering challenge.
13:46:02 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	general comment: you can use the laser pointer to point at things on the screen, but then you need to control your own presentation. This is a better way IMO
13:46:02 From  Jacob Pender-Ryall  to  Everyone:
	Will the professors stop the presentation for questions or is it only at the end?
13:46:23 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	@jacob...they will ask questions at the end of each student's time.
13:47:51 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	General comments for Deng: much better this week. You need to discuss the large data set challenge and explain why it happened (crashes). Memory issue?
13:48:01 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	No questions....keep going.
13:48:23 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Randi's slides:
13:49:16 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 18: great.
13:51:07 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 20: excellent. well done.
13:51:37 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 21: explain where the parameters came from.
13:52:34 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 22: ok....
13:53:51 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 24: doesn't look the same to me.
13:54:14 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Slide 23: use the same scale on x and y axis
13:55:21 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 25: same comment about learning software. not an engineering challenge.
13:56:23 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 27: nice. hard to keep up though.
13:57:41 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 29: ok. mention the data is sent to the ANN people in this format.
13:57:54 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	Everyone: do you know what is TE or TM mode?
13:58:06 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 30....different template for the slide?
13:58:22 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	good job overall.
13:58:32 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Jon's slides:
13:59:19 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 33: good. LOL at the image. Show your computer!
14:00:47 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	@group presentation: should include the gantt chart . Your group presentation is way too short
14:01:13 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 34: missing a figure? Why is text squished to the left?
14:02:15 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 35: lots of jargon. Epoch? learning rate? Rogers is going to have fun...
14:02:52 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 36: remember my suggestion to generate an image of the network.....
14:03:19 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 36: (6,50) etc....what does it mean?
14:03:47 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 37: what was your cost function? Training error measured how?
14:03:55 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	@Jon, add a bit details on how the ANN was set, the activation function and how the layers were related to each other
14:04:36 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 38: this is after removing bad data? Or maybe Jake talks about this later.
14:05:03 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Slide 39: Why TM prediction is worse?
14:07:44 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Slide 41: you haven't convinced me you did as much work as I know you did. Show some code. Show Jupyter. Show the ANN structure. Otherwise it's really questionable how much work you did on the project.
14:07:56 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	Jacob's slides:
14:09:39 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 43: good
14:10:38 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 44: code?
14:12:50 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 47: complete the slide.
14:13:14 From  Winnie Ye  to  Everyone:
	@Jacob, your legend is way too small to read
14:13:15 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 49-50: no idea what you mean by nodes....what nodes? where?
14:13:39 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 51: good concept.
14:16:36 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 55: it's not noise. it's just unrealistic data based on unrealistic parameters.
14:18:58 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 56: no idea what's going on. Explain it to Rogers.
14:19:05 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 57: ?
14:19:17 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	slide 58: ?
14:19:54 From  Leonard MacEachern  to  Everyone:
	needs to be completed. need practice!
